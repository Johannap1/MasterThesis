1) Get drone runnning with mpc identification experiment files to get evrything to last point 
2) Perform two step experiments to make sure that the controller model is still accurate (store them for later)
2) Run random path generator and collect data on quadrotor position (without any wind) 
	x vary the wait time at position 
	x make sure state and state prediction are recorded 
	x also record wind prediction coded by hand
	x change prediction model for the simulation to match 
	- push the code 
	- evtl use rope and kill switch 
	- adjust bounds
	- setup venv
