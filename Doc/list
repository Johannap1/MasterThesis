Tests to run 
--------------------------------
0) Check incoming data stream from optitrack system and from drone
	- I believe this can be done still from the desk with the companion computer 
	- Remap optitrack data topic to PX4 following the tutorial
	- RUn px4_uart.launch and check data stream from PX4 drone to companion computer echoing some \mavros message
1) Check data stream without any control - correct position and attitude feedback: https://askubuntu.com/questions/814/how-to-run-scripts-on-start-up
	- Add shell script in Startup Applications Preferences that launches 1) px4_uart.launch and 2) record_data.launch (look at/clone hovergames_mpc_identification repositry on 		github to companion computer)
	- Turn on the drone and without any flight control just pick it up in lab space and walk around, turn it etc. - eventually recalibrate if necessary
	- Afterwards, check data.bag file to see that a) the drone is recording data to the bag file and b) check that the recorded data is correct
2) Position (and attitdue) control with remote
	- Now control the drone with the remote 
	- Run same startup script to record data 
	- Check if data makes sense and see if first system ID is possible with data
2) Simple takeoff from ground and record hovering thrust
	- Instead of record_data.launch now use ID_exp.lauch setting it to a hovering experiment 
	- In ID_exp.launch set the following experiment combination: 5-1-2-1-0-0-0-1-1 (from top to bottom) - this will have the drone take off to 1m and hover there
	- Set the remote to have one switch to enable offboard mode (also see PX4 tutorial for this) 
	- Arm the drone and when ready flip switch to offboard mode, then the drone should start the hovering experiment 
	- After, look at hovering thrust and use that to adjust attitude controller
For later:
3) Remote position control 
4) Remote attitdue control and system ID experiments
