Meeting Dennis
----------------------------------------

- LMPCC:
	- LMPCC implementation does not work right/ is super fragile
	- When too far away from obstacle, implementation fails (both for exploration with GP experiment and final comparison experiment) 
	- Cannot track reference velocity correctly
	- Is there a better implementation/formulation somewhere?
	- uncertainty propagation now outside the solver with ROS service call --> Where to put the uncertainty propagator & interface
	- Soft versus hard chance constraints
	- Timing investigation (?) - How to compare
	- Robustness (?) 
	
- FORCES:
	- Works well with wind field in x-dir (also noise)
	- Gets stuck with wind in x-y-dir (too extreme changes ???) --> Do I have to prove that? 
	- Rate control vs their implementation, no controller feedback (???) 
	- What makes sense to assume as an initial uncertainty?
	
- GP: 
	- Now discrete versus previously continuous - propagation actually works much better
	- Issues with defined windfields (do that again?) 
	- Issue with propagating the uncertainty continuous versus discrete (especially with noise) - add some noise to the model

- System ID:
	- Explain controller tuning ? 
	
	
- Notation:
	- List of symbols
