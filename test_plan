TODO's:
---------------------------------------------

- Investigate the training parameters of the GP:
	1) Kernel: Matern Kernel versus RBF Kernel plus adding a linear kernel
	2) Sparse GP: Batch size and training epochs 
- Investigate the parameters of active learning:
	1) Number of points to sample at each iteration 
	2) Iterations to perform (perhaps stop when max uncertainty is reached) 
	2) (Radius of points to visit)
	3) (Number of samples taken into account during exploration)

- Decide on how much data to use for training: Use all samples versus only use some samples (perhaps the ones during exploration)
- Decide on number of inducing inputs 
- Investigate goodness of fit and uncertainty and decide on threshold that is "good enough"
- Investigate influence of noise on performance 
- Compare active learning with lemniscate trajectory or structured data collection to see if it is any better in terms of 
	1) Time of exploration 
	2) Training samlpes used 
	3) MSE and MAE and uncertainty (max and mean)
- Use points of TSP as indcing inputs(???)

Extensions:
-----------------------------------------------
- Move to Gazebo and do a re-evaluation
- Move to 3D case and do a re-evaluation
x Test for other wind fields as well


Planning: 
-----------------------------------------------

Idea: 

1) Fix #of points, radius, #of samples and #of incduicng inputs
2) Perform multiple iterations of active learning and check after each iteration 
	- Optimal Kernel for the problem
	- Optimal Hyperparametres of GP training 
	- Influence of those on active learning 
	Metric: MSE and MAE and uncertainty (man and mean)
3) Choose Kernel and fix hyperparameters of GP trainig and investigate 
	- Number of points to sample at each iteration 
	- Iteration to perform 
	- Radius of points to visit
	
	
	-Compare matern vs linear for more information available
	-Figure out optimal batch size for more data 
	
-Figure out how many iterations to make
